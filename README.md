## Features
- Select companies from a predefined list (e.g., Apple, Amazon).
- Choose a date range to fetch historical stock data.
- Display summary statistics of closing prices for each company.
- Visualize stock movements with line plots and candlestick charts.
- Apply K-Means clustering to analyze and identify patterns in stock movements.
- Normalize stock movements for comparative analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - yfinance
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - plotly
  - streamlit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-clustering-app.git
   cd stock-market-clustering-app
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the app using Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Select the desired companies and date range from the sidebar.

4. Explore the summary statistics and visualizations generated by the app.

## Code Explanation
- **Data Retrieval**: The app uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock prices based on user-selected companies and date ranges.
- **Data Cleaning**: It handles missing data by removing incomplete records before analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: The app calculates key statistics such as mean, max, and min closing prices for each selected company.
- **K-Means Clustering**: The app implements K-Means clustering to group similar stock movements and visualizes these clusters.
- **Visualizations**: Various plots are generated using `matplotlib` and `plotly`, including:
  - Line plots of opening and closing prices.
  - Candlestick charts showing price movements.
  - Scatter plots visualizing clustered data.
